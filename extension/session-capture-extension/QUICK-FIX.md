# Quick Fix for Service Worker Errors

## What was fixed in v1.0.2:

### ✅ Service Worker Registration (Status 15)
- Added `"alarms"` permission to manifest.json
- Added defensive API checking before using chrome.alarms
- Improved error handling throughout service worker

### ✅ Chrome API Undefined Errors  
- All chrome API calls now check for availability first
- Fallback methods for when APIs are not available
- Better error logging without breaking the extension

## Current Status:
The extension should now load successfully without service worker errors.

## Testing Steps:

1. **Reload the extension:**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click the refresh button on the "Session Capture" extension
   - Look for any error messages (should be none now)

2. **Test basic functionality:**
   - Open any website (e.g., https://github.com)
   - Click the extension icon
   - Verify popup opens without errors
   - Try capturing session data

3. **Check service worker:**
   - In `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click "service worker" link next to the extension
   - Should see console logs like "Session Capture Extension service worker started"
   - No error messages about undefined properties

## If still having issues:

1. **Hard reload:** Remove and re-add the extension completely
2. **Check Chrome version:** Ensure you're using Chrome 88+ 
3. **Check console:** Look for specific error messages in the extension service worker console

The extension is now much more robust and should handle missing APIs gracefully.
